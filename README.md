## how different are two samples? : examine rank order correlation via non-metric multi-dimensional scaling tools in R then test drive ggplot() to build the typical NMDS graphics from some imaginary ecological data 

---

### the data schema : random data with some realistic relationships and a hidden correlation :

### the "random" ecological data: species ocurrances distributed along a transect that begins in the field margin and extends into the field

### the typical dissimilarity plots; by species

### and dissimilarity by transect position

### the mystery plot ():

---
### the 'ordination' plot: trying to visualize the magnitude of difference in multi-dimensional space (if the ellipses appear parallel then the distributions of those factor observations are 'similar' (?) )

####
read data with R:

```R
	> library(RCurl)
	> source.url <- c("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cordphelps/transect/master/data/hvb.csv")
	> dataframe.df <- read.csv(text=getURLContent(source.url), header=TRUE, row.names=1)
```
