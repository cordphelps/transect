### the "random" ecological data: species ocurrances distributed along a transect that begins in the field margin and extends into the field

### the typical dissimilarity plots; by species 


### and dissimilarity by transect position

### the mystery plot:  

### the 'ordination' plot: trying to visualize 


####
read data with R:

```R
	> library(RCurl)
	> source.url <- c("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cordphelps/transect/master/data/hvb.csv")
	> dataframe.df <- read.csv(text=getURLContent(source.url), header=TRUE, row.names=1)
