## how different are several multi-species transect samples? with some imaginary ecological data :
- demonstrate rank order correlations in two dimensions (dissimilarity plots)
- experiment with stressplot() 
- build typical NMDS (non-metric multi-dimensional scaling) graphics to demo clustering by factor 
- demo a distribution plot for multiple datasets

### the data schema : random data with some realistic relationships and a hidden correlation :

### the 'random' ecological data: species ocurrances distributed along a transect that begins in the field margin and extends into the field

---
### the typical dissimilarity plots; by species (suggesting which species distributions occuring in a transect are most similar/dissimilar)

---
### and dissimilarity by transect position (suggesting which transect distributions, by gradient, of all species are most similar/dissimilar)
#### TODO: normalize the counts of individual species

### the mystery stressplot():

---
### the 'ordination' plot: trying to visualize the magnitude of distribution variation in multi-dimensional space as a function of some factor. (if the ellipses appear parallel then the distributions of those factor observations are 'similar' (?) )

### comparing multi-species transect samples

####
read data with R:

```R
	> library(RCurl)
	> source.url <- c("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cordphelps/transect/master/data/hvb5.csv")
	> dataframe.df <- read.csv(text=getURLContent(source.url), header=TRUE, row.names=1)
```
